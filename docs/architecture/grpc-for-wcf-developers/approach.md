# How gRPC approaches RPC

The following table sets out how the key features of WCF relate to gRPC and where you can find more detailed explanations in the rest of the Book.

| Features | WCF | gRPC |
| -------- | --- | ---- |
| Objective | Separate business code from networking implementation | Separate business code from interface definition and networking implementation |
| Define Services and messages(Ch 3-4)  | Service Contract, Operation Contract and Data Contract | Uses proto file |
| Language (Ch 3-5) | Contracts written in C# or VB.NET | Custom Interface Definition Language |
| Wire format (Ch 3) | Configurable, including SOAP/XML, Plain XML, JSON, .NET Binary, etc. | Protocol Buffers (although it is possible to use other formats).
| Interoperability (Ch 4) | When using SOAP over HTTP | Official support: .NET, Java, Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Go, Rust, Ruby, Swift, Dart, PHP. Unofficial support for other languages from the community. |
| Networking (Ch 4) | Configured at runtime. Switch between TCP, HTTP, MSMQ etcâ€¦ | Always HTTP/2 |
| Approach (Ch 4) | Runtime generation of serialization /deserialization and networking code in base classes | Build-time generation of serialization /deserialization and networking code in base classes |
| Security (Ch 6) | Authentication, WS-Security, message encryption | Credentials, ASP.NET Core security, SSL/TLS networking |
