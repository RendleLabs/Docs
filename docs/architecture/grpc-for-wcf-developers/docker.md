## Microsoft base images for ASP.NET Core applications

Microsoft provide a range of base images for building and running .NET Core applications. To create an ASP.NET Core 3.0 image, two base images are used: an SDK image to build and publish the application, and a runtime image for deployment.

| Image | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-sdk/) | For building applications with `docker build`. Not to be used in production. |
| [mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-aspnet/) | Contains the runtime and ASP.NET Core dependencies. For production. |

For each image, there are four variants based on different Linux distributions, distinguished by tags.

| Image tag(s) | Linux | Notes |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| 3.0-buster, 3.0 | Debian 10 | The default image if no OS variant is specified. |
| 3.0-alpine | Alpine 3.9 | Alpine base images are much smaller than Debian or Ubuntu ones. |
| 3.0-disco | Ubuntu 19.04 | |
| 3.0-bionic | Ubuntu 18.04 | |

The Alpine base image is around 100MB, compared to 200MB for the Debian and Ubuntu images, but some software packages or libraries may not be available in Alpine's package management. If you're not sure which image to use, it's best to stick to the default Debian unless you have a compelling need to use a different distro.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you use the same variant of Linux for the build and the runtime. Applications built and published on one variant may not work on another.

## Creating a Docker image

A Docker image is defined by a *Dockerfile*, a text file that contains all the commands needed to build the application as well as install any dependencies required for either building or running the application. This is the simplest Dockerfile for an ASP.NET Core 3.0 application.

```dockerfile
# Application build steps
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0 as builder

WORKDIR /src

COPY . .

RUN dotnet restore

RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /published src/TraderSys.Portfolios/TraderSys.Portfolios.csproj

# Runtime image creation
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.0

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /published .

ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "TraderSys.Portfolios.dll" ]
```

The Dockerfile has two parts: the first uses the `sdk` base image to build and publish the application; the second creates a runtime image from the `aspnet` base. This is because the `sdk` image is around 900MB compared to around 200MB for the runtime image, and most of its contents are unnecessary at runtime.

### The build steps

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `FROM ...` | Declares the base image and assigns the `builder` alias (see next section for explanation). |
| `WORKDIR /src` | Creates the `/src` directory and sets it as the current working directory. |
| `COPY . .` | Copies everything below the current directory on the host into the current directory on the image. |
| `RUN dotnet restore` | Restores any external packages (ASP.NET Core 3.0 framework is pre-installed with the SDK). |
| `RUN dotnet publish ...` | Builds and publishes a Release build. Note that the `--runtime` flag is not required. |

### The runtime image steps

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `FROM ...` | Declares a new base image. |
| `WORKDIR /app` | Creates the `/app` directory and sets it as the current working directory. |
| `COPY --from=builder ...` | Copies the published application from the previous image, using the `builder` alias from the first `FROM` line. |
| `ENTRYPOINT [ ... ]` | Sets the command to run when the container starts. The `dotnet` command in the runtime image can only run DLL files. |

### The .dockerignore file

Much like `.gitignore` files which exclude certain files and directories from source control, the `.dockerignore` file can be used to exclude files and directories from being copied to the image during build. This not only saves time copying, but can also avoid some confusing errors that arise from having (particularly) the `obj` directory from your PC copied into the image. You should add at least entries for `bin` and `obj` to your `.dockerignore` file.

```console
bin/
obj/
```

### Building the image

For a solution with a single application, and thus a single Dockerfile, it is simplest to put the Dockerfile in the base directory; that is, the same directory as the `.sln` file. In that case, to build the image, use the following `docker build` command from the directory containing the Dockerfile.

```console
docker build --tag portfolios .
```

The confusingly-named `--tag` flag (which can be shortened to `-t`) specifies the whole name of the image, *including* the actual tag if specified. The `.` at the end specifies the *context* in which the build will be run; the current working directory for the `COPY` commands in the Dockerfile.

If you have multiple applications within a single solution, you can keep the Dockerfile for each application in its own folder, beside the `.csproj` file, but you should still run the `docker build` command from the base directory to ensure that the solution and all the projects are copied into the image. You can specify a Dockerfile below the current directory using the `--file` (or `-f`) flag.

```console
docker build --tag portfolios --file src/Portfolios/Dockerfile .
```
